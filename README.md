# Lower-NFL-Injuries
Graduate Project done in RStudio. </br>
</br>
Goal is to find out, in the data, if the field, weather, or type of play is a factor in lower leg injuries in the NFL
<h2> Hypothesis  </h2> 
From personal experience, I assume that the most common way to injure the lower limbs would happen on the turf field. My reasoning is that the turf field can be slippery and cleats don’t have a great grip on the ground much as it does on the grass. But since most stadiums are played with an open roof weather can be a huge factor in injuries. Rain can make the grass softer and can’t get an excellent grip too. Also if it's warmer temperatures, cramping and injuries are more prone to happen. While turf fields are most likely in indoor stadiums and have climate-controlled built-in, making the weather not a factor for the injuries. Therefore I would say that turf is the most common way for NFL players to injure their lower limbs. But if I strictly look at the grass field, which a lot of stadiums are, I would assume that the games that were raining are also a common way of injuring their lower limbs.
